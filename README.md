# MSFS GeoShot

GeoShot is a **screenshot** tool for **Microsoft Flight Simulator**. It allows users to create metadata-enriched screenshots of their flights, enabling use cases such as keeping track of screenshot locations via **geotags**.

## MSFS 2024 Support

This fork adds compatibility with **Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024**.
The original tool only detected `FlightSimulator.exe` (MSFS 2020). This fork
also detects `FlightSimulator2024.exe`, making it work with both versions.

### Running from source (MSFS 2020 or 2024)

**Requirements:** Python 3.9+, 64-bit Windows
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fitzroymckay/msfs-geoshot.git
cd msfs-geoshot
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install SimConnect psutil PyQt5 multiexit piexif requests Pillow pywin32 pyqt5-tools
pyuic5 qtdesigner\feedback.ui -o msfs_geoshot\gui\forms\feedback.py
pyuic5 qtdesigner\main_window.ui -o msfs_geoshot\gui\forms\main_window.py
New-Item msfs_geoshot\gui\forms\__init__.py -Type File
python -m msfs_geoshot
```

Start MSFS 2024 and load into a flight before running the tool.

> **This is a fork of [pyviator/msfs-geoshot](https://github.com/pyviator/msfs-geoshot)
> with MSFS 2024 compatibility added.** The only change is in `sim.py` to detect
> `FlightSimulator2024.exe` in addition to `FlightSimulator.exe`.
